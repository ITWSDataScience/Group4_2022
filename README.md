As the global carbon market develops and the  Annual Energy Outlook 2022 by EIA, renewable energy takes a more important role in the energy market which reduces the impact of climate change global warming.In renewable energy, the biggest two sectors of renewable energy are solar and wind which more and more renewable power plant will be establish in the future. All the models show that the related energy used, speed and location are important features that influence the power output of a power plant. In the future, our study may give people more insights about how to locate a power plant to a better location and improve the production efficiency. 



This project is about the get the renewable energy fron the NASA and anaysis the data relationship with our project.
